    "# Bitcoin Market & News Analytics: Data Engineering Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This technical assessment evaluates your data engineering skills through the implementation of a dual-pipeline system for Bitcoin market data and news analytics. You'll build a complete data processing workflow following the medallion architecture pattern (Bronze-Silver-Gold).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "- **Real-time Data**: Bitcoin price data from any public cryptocurrency API\n",
    "- **Batch Data**: Bitcoin news CSV (provided at `data/news_btc.csv`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline Architecture\n",
    "Implement a Bronze-Silver-Gold medallion architecture with the following layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bronze Layer \n",
    "- Raw data ingestion without modification\n",
    "- Schema validation for consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Silver Layer\n",
    "- Data cleaning and standardization\n",
    "- Timestamp normalization\n",
    "- Missing value handling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gold Layer\n",
    "- Feature engineering (price indicators, news sentiment)  \n",
    "- Aggregations and metrics calculation\n",
    "- Data quality testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Components\n",
    "- Real-time pipeline with configurable update frequency\n",
    "- Batch processing for news data analysis\n",
    "- SQLite/PostgreSQL database for persistent storage\n",
    "- Comprehensive logging and error handling\n",
    "- Documentation of code and architecture decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Configure Data Ingestion\n",
    "- Set up API connection for Bitcoin prices\n",
    "- Import news CSV to dataframe\n",
    "- Create database schema for both data types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Build Bronze → Silver → Gold Pipeline\n",
    "- Implement real-time data processing\n",
    "- Process historical news data\n",
    "- Add data quality checks at each stage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3: Create Analysis Components\n",
    "- Calculate technical indicators for price data\n",
    "- Extract sentiment scores from news headlines \n",
    "- Correlate price movements with news sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables (GH Repository)\n",
    "- A GitHub repository containing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Fully functional Python code in Jupyter notebook\n",
    "    - SQLite database with processed data tables\n",
    "    - Brief documentation explaining your approach\n",
    "    - README file with instructions to run the pipeline\n",
    "    - Bonus:  Do a sample strategy using the processed data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution will be evaluated based on:\n",
    "- Code quality and organization\n",
    "- Pipeline architecture and robustness\n",
    "- Error handling and logging implementation\n",
    "- Documentation clarity\n",
    "- Technical approach to data processing\n",
    "- Working end-to-end pipeline"
